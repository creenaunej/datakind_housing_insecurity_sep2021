## R Markdown



```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)  #helps wrangle data
library(lubridate)  #helps wrangle date attributes
library(janitor)    #helps to compare columns in dfs 


#Set a working directory 
setwd("/Users/jordancreenaune/Documents/R/datakind")
#Import two data sets needed for this analysis 
variable_dict_df <- read.csv("acs5_variable_dict_2014_2019.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
