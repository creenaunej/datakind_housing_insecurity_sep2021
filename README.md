# datakind_housing_insecurity_2021 copy

This project was part of an exploratory investigation for Datakind Sep 17, 2021. 

Perform a comparative analysis of two different 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) datasets, assessing which variables changed, by what magnitude they changed, and which variables saw statistically significant changes even after the provided margins of error are taken into account. Additionally, volunteers will engineer new features in the housing loss data sets pertaining to these differences and assess whether or not increased rates of evictions and/or foreclosures are associated with changes in the demographics of census tracts.
